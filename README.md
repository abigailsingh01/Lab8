# CICS. 3140 Lab 8
TASK 1
- Check if an input string is a palindrome, return a boolean value. Allow list input type. Suggested implementation: Write your own reverser function.

TASK 2
- Create a lambda expression that evaluates a sum of series (i.e. fibonacci sequence) given a number input n. Suggested implementation: combine your lambda expression with a map so that you can pass in a list of numbers and get the sum of series that returns a list.

TASK 3
- Create a function that will calculate two input parameters, but only if they're both valid types for calculation. Use Scheme's syntax and available functions for checking types.
